		About Momus.io
	</h1>
	<p>
		Who's Momus? He's the Greek god of sarcasm. Maybe not the best figure to
		name a site after, but here we are.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've been saying for years that I wanted to create a portfolio site - and
		really just something to test my coding skills in general. Ostensibly, it's
		an SPA and API for accessing data on mythological figures, but actually
		loading that into my databse is going to take some time, so bear withn me.
	</p>
	<p>
		In terms of tech stack, I built this using Svelte and Bulma for the
		frontend, Node and Express on the backend, and PostgreSQL and Prisma for the
		database layer.
